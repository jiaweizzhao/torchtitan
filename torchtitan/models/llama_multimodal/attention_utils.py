    Reshape frequency tensor for broadcasting it with another tensor.

    This function reshapes the frequency tensor to have the same shape as the target tensor 'x'

    The input freqs_cis tensor is assumed to be of shape (max_seqlen, dim),

    Args:
        freqs_cis (torch.Tensor): Frequency tensor to be reshaped.
